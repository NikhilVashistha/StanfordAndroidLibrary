		<h2>FAQ:</h2>
		
		<dl>
			<dt>
				<strong>Q:</strong> I'm looking at the docs, and a feature that's listed isn't compiling!
				I don't think the feature is there in my JAR at all.
			</dt>
			
			<dd>
				<strong>A:</strong> Are you sure you have the latest version of the JAR?
				Try re-downloading it from here into your project's app/libs/ folder and compiling again.
